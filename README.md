My final project implementation will be a graph implementation that takes user input & creates Binary Search Trees. The code will begin by asking you how many nodes you want the tree to contain & then will proceed to ask you what value each node will contain. After the BST is created there will be a few options printed in a menu for the user. The main idea will be a print option that will print the entire BST in ASCII art like so:


                                                    50
                                                  /    \
                                                 /      \
                                                25      75
